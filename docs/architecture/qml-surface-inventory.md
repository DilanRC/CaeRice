# Cortetsu QML surface inventory

Baseline: `9219189` (`Hide inactive popup backgrounds cleanly`).

The active first-party composition enters through `cortetsu/shell.qml`. The
`cortetsu/modules` tree owns visible Cortetsu surfaces. `cortetsu/base` is an
upstream compatibility tree and is counted here only where an owned module
composes it directly. `cortetsu/modules/nexus` is the detached settings and
control surface used by the owned popup wrapper.

Maturity is intentionally conservative. A surface is `VERIFIED` only after
static checks, real runtime interaction, keyboard checks, visual inspection,
and clean journal evidence. Technical gates alone do not promote a surface.

## Wave 0 foundation status

Existing shared contracts are `CortetsuDesign.js`, `CortetsuTokens.qml`,
`CortetsuColours.qml`, `CortetsuSurface.qml`, `CortetsuButton.qml`,
`CortetsuListRow.qml`, `CortetsuSectionHeader.qml`, `CortetsuSlider.qml`,
`CortetsuToggle.qml`, `CortetsuText.qml`, and `CortetsuStateLayer.qml`.

This checkpoint adds keyboard focus and activation to the two most common
interactive primitives. It does not change popup anchoring, screen selection,
service ownership, or detached popup behavior.

## Launcher verification evidence

The promoted runtime was opened on both monitors. On the right monitor,
searching `kitty` produced a selected application result and Enter launched a
new Kitty instance. Escape closed the launcher. On the left monitor, a
wallpaper query rendered the first-party empty state. The shell remained
active with zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Quick Settings verification evidence

Quick Settings was opened on both monitors. The Keep-awake control changed to
its active visual state and was restored to `Allow idle`; Notification controls
opened the notification center, and Escape closed the overlay. Static utility
gates passed, including first-party ownership and keyboard-capable controls.
The shell remained active with zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical
journal entries.

## Display, Hardware and Wallpaper verification evidence

The promoted runtime opened Display Manager, Hardware Center and Wallpaper
Manager through their first-party IPC targets. Display Manager rendered the
two-monitor topology and layout controls; Hardware Center rendered live CPU,
memory, storage, GPU, battery and sensor cards; Wallpaper Manager rendered the
preview orbit, category controls, current selection and Cancel/Random/Apply
actions. Escape closed the active overlay sequence. The shell stayed active
with zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Keyboard Layout and Lock Status verification evidence

The promoted runtime opened both popups through `bottomHub control` on the
right monitor. Keyboard Layout showed the active `Spanish (LA)` layout and the
empty additional-layout state. Lock Status showed the live Caps Lock and Num
Lock indicators. Escape closed the active popup sequence; the shell stayed
active with zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Battery verification evidence

The promoted runtime opened Battery through `bottomHub control battery`. The
popup rendered the real 100% power state, charge timing text and the selected
Performance profile. Profile controls expose focus and Enter/Return/Space
activation; Escape closed the popup and `powerprofilesctl get` remained
`performance`. The shell stayed active with zero restarts and no new
warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Network, Audio and Bluetooth verification evidence

The promoted runtime opened each popup through the `bottomHub control` IPC on
the right monitor. Network rendered two available networks with the connected
state; Audio rendered the current output, volume slider and output devices;
Bluetooth rendered a ready adapter and paired devices. Escape closed the
active popup after the sequence. Static native-popup gates passed and the
shell stayed active with zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical
journal entries.

## Window Info verification evidence

The detached Window Info surface was opened through `bottomHub control winfo`
after focusing a live Kitty window on the right monitor. The full-screen
drawer host rendered the first-party card with the active title, class,
address, workspace, monitor and size, plus Float, Pin, Close and workspace
controls. Tab moved focus through the controls; Escape closed the surface, and
the `Done` button also closed it by mouse. The shell stayed active with zero
restarts and no new warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Active Window verification evidence

The `bottomHub control activewindow` IPC opened the first-party attached
popup on the right monitor with a live Kitty title/class and screencopy
preview. The Details action remains connected to the detached Window Info
surface; Escape closed the attached popup, and the shell stayed active with
zero restarts and no new warning/error/critical journal entries.

## Overview verification evidence

The promoted runtime rendered the adaptive overview grid with live windows on
the right monitor, workspace/monitor badges and the empty workspace chips.
Keyboard selection and `F` floating action were exercised and the floating
state was restored. A temporary Kitty card was closed through the card mouse
action, and a second temporary card was dragged from workspace 1 to workspace
2 through the visible workspace rail. Clicking the empty workspace 3 chip
closed Overview and Hyprland confirmed `eDP-1` on workspace 3. Escape closed
the overview sequence; the shell stayed active with zero restarts and no new
warning/error/critical journal entries.
