# Launcher: Zero-Caelestia migration

The launcher used to be built from 9 Caelestia patches stacked on top of
upstream `modules/launcher/*.qml`:

- 5 "base" patches rewrote the widget itself (grid layout, favourites,
  scoped app launching, dock offset, wallpaper-on-top layout):
  `AppList.qml.patch`, `Content.qml.patch`, `ContentList.qml.patch`,
  `Wrapper.qml.patch`, `services__Apps.qml.patch`.
- 4 more patches were stacked **on top of** those (applied later in
  `MANIFEST.tsv` order) purely to swap every remaining
  `GlobalConfig.launcher.*` / `GlobalConfig.general.apps.terminal`
  reference for `CortetsuConfig.*`: `CortetsuConfig.qml.patch` (touched
  `AppList.qml` + `services/Apps.qml`), `CortetsuConfigMore.qml.patch`
  (touched `ContentList.qml` + the now-dead `items/CalcItem.qml`),
  `SearchPreferences.qml.patch` (touched `services/Actions.qml`,
  `services/Schemes.qml`, `services/M3Variants.qml`), and
  `RemainingConfig.qml.patch` (touched `Content.qml` + the now-dead
  `items/AppItem.qml`).

All 9 are gone. The launcher now lives entirely as first-party QML under
`cortetsu/modules/launcher/`, which `cortetsu/bin/build-runtime.sh` copies
straight over whatever the upstream archive + remaining patches produce
(`cp -a cortetsu/modules/. STAGING/modules/` runs *after* patches are
applied). Editing the launcher is now a normal QML edit, not a diff
against a moving upstream target.

## Why `items/AppItem.qml` and `items/CalcItem.qml` were left behind

The original `AppList.qml.patch` replaced the whole `ListView` with a
`GridView` and inlined every delegate (`appDelegate`, `actionDelegate`,
`calcDelegate`, `schemeDelegate`, `variantDelegate`) directly in
`AppList.qml`, dropping `import qs.modules.launcher.items` entirely.
Verified against the exact pinned upstream commit
(`caelestia-shell@24aa15ee`, tag `v2.4.0`): nothing else in the upstream
tree references `AppItem`, `ActionItem`, `CalcItem`, `SchemeItem`, or
`VariantItem` by type name (`WallpaperList.qml` does `import "items"` but
only uses `WallpaperItem`, which is untouched by any of our patches).
Those five files are dead code post-migration. We do not carry them
forward into `cortetsu/modules/launcher/items/`; they stay as
unreferenced, harmless leftovers in the ephemeral upstream build
staging directory.

## `useFuzzy.{apps,actions,schemes,variants}` -> one `useFuzzyApps` flag

Upstream `GlobalConfig.launcher.useFuzzy` was a 4-key object
(`apps`/`actions`/`schemes`/`variants`), each independently toggling
fuzzy search per search domain. `CortetsuConfig.qml` predates this
migration and already only exposes a single `useFuzzyApps: bool` (plus a
separate `useFuzzyWallpapers` for the wallpaper picker, which is not part
of the launcher scope). Rather than add three more booleans that nobody
has ever asked to set independently, this migration keeps the existing
convention: `services/Apps.qml`, `services/Actions.qml`,
`services/Schemes.qml`, and `services/M3Variants.qml` all read
`CortetsuConfig.useFuzzyApps`. If per-domain fuzzy toggles are ever
actually needed, split `useFuzzyApps` into the 4 keys in
`CortetsuConfig.qml` (with a `migrate_config.py` backfill) and repoint
each service — a small, contained change once there's a real requirement.

## Terminal command: two sources of truth, on purpose (for now)

`GlobalConfig.general.apps.terminal` fed two different consumers:

1. **Hyprland itself** — `dotfiles/home/.config/hypr/variables.lua` sets
   `vars.terminal = "/home/dilan/.local/bin/kitty-tab"`, consumed by
   Hyprland's own keybinds (e.g. `Super+Return`) to spawn an interactive
   terminal session. This is Lua, loaded by Hyprland directly, and is
   **not owned by this task**.
2. **The QML launcher** — `CortetsuConfig.qml`'s `terminalCommand`
   (`list<string>`, default `["kitty"]`) is used by
   `cortetsu/modules/launcher/AppList.qml` (calc "open in terminal") and
   `cortetsu/modules/launcher/services/Apps.qml` (`entry.runInTerminal`
   app launches via `wrap_term_launch.sh`). This needs an argv list, not
   a single string, because it's spliced into `Quickshell.execDetached`
   command arrays alongside extra arguments.

**Decision:** these stay two independently configured values. They are
not accidentally duplicated — they were already two different upstream
fields feeding two different runtimes, `CortetsuConfig.terminalCommand`
already existed before this task, and this migration only removed the
`GlobalConfig` middleman for the QML side. Unifying them (e.g. Hyprland's
Lua reading `terminalCommand[0]` out of `~/.config/cortetsu/preferences.json`
at reload) is a real option, but it means teaching the Hyprland config
loader to parse JSON at startup, which is Hyprland/dotfiles-platform
territory (see `feat(hyprland): zero-caelestia hypr-user.lua/hypr-vars.lua`
and related commits), not launcher territory, and is out of this task's
scope per the coordinator's instructions. **If a future task unifies
Hyprland config loading around `preferences.json`, `vars.terminal` should
be re-pointed at `terminalCommand[0]` then** — flagging here so it isn't
lost.

## Verification

`git archive` at the pinned upstream commit
(`caelestia-shell@24aa15eefdb146350d2548c0a015b04eddbd1008`, tag
`v2.4.0`, matching `caelestia/compatibility.json`) was fetched from the
already-cached local checkout
(`~/.local/share/caelestia-custom-system/upstream-git`), and all 9
retired patches were applied to it in `MANIFEST.tsv` order with real
`patch -p1` (not by hand-reconstructing diffs) to produce the exact
pre-migration output. That output was diffed against
`cortetsu/modules/launcher/*` to confirm behavioural parity, and grepped
to confirm zero `GlobalConfig` references either way (the old patch
stack already fully eliminated `GlobalConfig` from the *built* output —
this migration's value is retiring the 9-patch dependency chain itself,
not reducing a runtime `GlobalConfig` count that was already zero).

Regression coverage: `scripts/features/test-cortetsu-launcher.py` (new),
`scripts/features/test-cortetsu-config.py` (updated to assert against the
first-party files instead of the retired patches), and
`scripts/features/test-launcher-process-scope.py` (updated the same way).
All three are wired into `scripts/cortetsu test`.
